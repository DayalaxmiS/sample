Builder Pattern

Overview
The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

Code Analysis
In this example, the Builder Pattern is implemented in a meal ordering system where users can build their custom meal. The Meal class represents the product being built. The MealBuilder interface defines the steps for building a meal, and the VegMealBuilder and NonVegMealBuilder classes are concrete builders that construct different types of meals. The MealDirector class directs the meal construction process. This pattern provides a flexible solution for constructing complex objects, allowing for different representations and configurations.
