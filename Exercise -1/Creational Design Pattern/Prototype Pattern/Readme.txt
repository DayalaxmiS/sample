Prototype Pattern

Overview
The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes. This pattern is used when the cost of creating a new object is expensive or complicated.

Code Analysis
In this example, the Prototype Pattern is implemented in a shape cloning system where users can clone shapes based on their selection. The Shape class is the prototype that defines the clone method for creating copies of itself. The Circle and Rectangle classes are concrete prototypes that implement the cloning behavior. The ShapeCache class stores a registry of shape objects and provides a method to retrieve and clone shapes. This pattern is useful for creating new instances that are copies of existing instances, reducing the overhead of creating complex objects from scratch.
