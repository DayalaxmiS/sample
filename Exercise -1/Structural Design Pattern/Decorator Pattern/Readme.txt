Decorator Pattern

Overview
The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern is typically used to extend the functionalities of classes in a flexible and reusable way.

Code Analysis
In this example, the Decorator Pattern is implemented in a text formatting system where users can dynamically add various formatting options. The Text interface defines the method for formatting text. The PlainText class is a concrete component that implements the Text interface. The TextDecorator class is an abstract decorator that wraps a Text object. The BoldText, ItalicText, and UnderlineText classes are concrete decorators that add specific formatting to the text. This pattern allows for flexible and dynamic composition of behavior, making it easy to add or remove functionalities at runtime.
