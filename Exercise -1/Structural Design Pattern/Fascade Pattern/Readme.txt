Facade Pattern

Overview
The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. This pattern defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

Code Analysis
In this example, the Facade Pattern is implemented in a computer system where users can start or shut down the computer using simple commands. The CPU, Memory, and HardDrive classes represent the subsystem components. The ComputerFacade class provides a simplified interface to start and shut down the computer by interacting with the subsystem components. This pattern hides the complexity of the subsystem and provides a straightforward interface for the client, making the system easier to use.
