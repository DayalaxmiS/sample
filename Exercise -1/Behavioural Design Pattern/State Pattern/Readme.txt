State Pattern

Overview
The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

Code Analysis
In this example, the State Pattern is implemented in a vending machine system that handles different states such as NoCoinState, HasCoinState, and SoldState. The VendingMachine class acts as the context that holds a state instance representing the current state. Each state class implements the State interface, defining behavior specific to that state. The vending machine changes its behavior based on its current state, providing a clear structure for managing state-specific behavior and transitions.
